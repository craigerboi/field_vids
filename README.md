# Field Gifs!

I thought these videos were interesting to see the evolution of these fields obeying the Laplace equation. The endpoint of both videos is not the actual point of convergence, for Von Neumann boundary data the video is only about 10% of the whole story. Note the Dirichlet system converging faster.

I found thinking about it as though I was watching a system reaching thermodynamic equilibrium was satisfying. If we consider the field as reprsenting temperature in space, with contacts at the edges and on the 1, -1 zones, then Dirichlet conditions meant no heat transfer, Von Neumann no net heat flow. 

Of course, this also has application in electrodynamics!
