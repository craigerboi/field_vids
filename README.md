# Field Gifs!

Despite the fact that gifs are horrible and use too much memory I thought these videos were interesting to see the evolution of these fields obeying the Laplace equation. The endpoint of both videos is not the actual point of convergence, for Von Neumann boundary data the video is only about 10% of the whole story. Note the Dirichlet system converging faster.
